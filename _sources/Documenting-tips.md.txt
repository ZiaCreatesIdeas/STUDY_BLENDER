There is a trade of between memory retention duration, and screen space.  
If users have two screens, that is ideal.  
Dropbox does not have a dedicated hot key for pause, nor rewind. Thus many of the lessons are slowed down.   
Note, Blender does have a way to play movies within the Blender interface. 
Share X on PC is ideal for capturing still and videos as it has repeatable Screen capture guides.  
gif's repeat - useful for single steps. 
Dropbox - ideally, should either repeat every action twice. Or allow pause.  
Maybe video overview on top, then step by step break down below and slim.
I wish there was a way to slow down the drop box videos.User side. 
Ulitimately, it looks like yt has a better feature set for embedded videos, but with terrible ads.
